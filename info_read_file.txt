1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose of the Manual

The purpose of this manual is to guide you through the process of creating a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. It provides step-by-step instructions on preparing the environment, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation.

1.2 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict house prices based on various features related to the houses, such as 'area','bedrooms','bathrooms',
'stories','mainroad','guestroom', 
'basement', 'hotwaterheating', 'airconditioning',
'parking', 'prefarea', 'furnishingstatus'].
 We'll use Linear Regression, a commonly used algorithm for regression tasks, to build our predictive model.

2. Preparing the Environment

2.1 Software and Libraries
Ensure you have the necessary software installed (e.g., Python ) and libraries like 
@ scikit-learn,
@ pandas, 
@ seaborn for data analysis and machine learning.
Software IDE :Google Colab.

2.2 Dataset
"Housing.csv".
Acquire a dataset containing information about houses and their corresponding prices. Common sources include online repositories or real estate websites.
eg:Kaggle Website

2.3 Data Preprocessing
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any anomalies in the data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3.1 Data Visualization
Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features, relationships, and potential patterns.

3.2 Handling Missing Data
Impute or remove missing data to ensure the dataset is ready for feature engineering and modeling.
but in our case there is no missing values available.

4. Feature Engineering

4.1 Feature Selection
Select relevant features that contribute to predicting house prices effectively.
e.g.:Depenedent(X) and independent(X)


5. Model Selection and Training

5.1 Linear Regression Overview

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables.
Y=mX+c.

Linear regression is a foundational concept in machine learning and serves as a basis for more complex models and techniques. Extensions of linear regression include multiple linear regression (involving more than one independent variable), polynomial regression, and more




5.2 Training-Testing Split
70-30:Training and testing ratio.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to train the model on one and evaluate on the other.

5.3 Training the Linear Regression Model
Train the Linear Regression model using the training data and the selected features.

6. Model Evaluation
6.1 Evaluation Metrics
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.


7.Conclusion

The house price prediction project successfully leveraged advanced machine learning techniques to accurately estimate property values. Through meticulous data analysis, feature engineering, and model selection, we achieved a reliable predictive model that can assist in making informed real estate decisions. The outcomes demonstrate the potential of machine learning in aiding both buyers and sellers to navigate the housing market with confidence and precision, paving the way for future advancements in property valuation and market forecasting.
